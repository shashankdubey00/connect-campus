## 📊 How It Works

### Active Students Count (College Chat)
```
User connects → lastSeen updated in DB
User disconnects → lastSeen updated in DB
Query: Count users with lastSeen >= 24 hours ago
Display: "X students active today"
```

### Online Status (Private Chat)
```
User connects → Socket.IO emits 'userOnline'
Other user sees → "Online" status
User disconnects → Socket.IO emits 'userOffline'
Other user sees → "Last seen at [time]"
```

### Typing Indicator
```
User types → Emit typing event
After 2s inactivity → Emit stop typing
Input empty → Stop typing immediately
Other user sees → "typing..." with animation
```
